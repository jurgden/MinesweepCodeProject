# MinesweepCodeProject

I am working on following a project by freecodecamp.org , this project specifically focuses on creating a minesweeper program. 
I will commit all of the necessary completed checkpoints in the Main branch. Followed by a backup branch. Also an experimental branch so I can try
some things out on my own , like morphing the project into a tic tac toe like game or a text based adventure. 

Stay tuned!
